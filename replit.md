# Overview

This project appears to be for the "Lacanoamericana Mar del Plata 2024" - a psychoanalysis conference taking place in Mar del Plata from September 25-28, 2024. The repository contains both a static HTML website and a React/TypeScript web application with PayPal payment integration for registration and conference management.

The application provides functionality for event information display, registration forms, payment processing, and attendee management. The project structure suggests a dual approach with both a traditional HTML site and a modern React application.

- **Build System**: ESBuild for server bundling, Vite for client bundling

## Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM providing type-safe database queries
